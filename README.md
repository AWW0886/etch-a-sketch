OMG... help... lol...

July UPDATE:
Getting there... plan to come back to figure out/implement different color options.

So I still have to figure out how to have buttons to change the color options with each click... I was intially trying to use a toggle to work for this, but I figured it might be easier to try the button option for now, as I'm not sure that a toggle is even capable of doing this.

July UPDATE #2:
Figured out the buttons! But the reset button now needs tweeking... Functions incorrectly when pressed and entering a number greater than the previous.
